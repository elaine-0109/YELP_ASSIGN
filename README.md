# YELP_ASSIGN


1. Use Java (Kotlin for bonus points) and adapt to all Android phone screen sizes.
2. Implement a keyword search that returns 10 restaurants from the Yelp API
3. The results should be displayed in a “grid” (i.e. 2x5) view that includes restaurant name and address
4. Make this grid sortable alphabetically by restaurant name (asc/desc)
5. You should be able to tap each grid item to be taken to a detail view
6. The Detail view of each restaurant should include the latest review and a photo as well as the name and address
